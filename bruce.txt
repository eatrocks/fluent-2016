For windows, change this in package.json
"build": "NODE_ENV=production webpack",
to this
"build": "set NODE_ENV=production&& webpack",

Building this app
https://fluentconf.surge.sh

"Standard" Linter
pre-configured ESLint that doesn't require/allow? semicolons
only 2 cases of missing semi-colons that cause problems and the linter catches both

make sure you include the dedupe plugin to webpack.

// static app hosting service - free for subdomains
surge.sh
200.html is your catch-all
404.html is your error page
sign up from the command line
npm install --global surge
>surge

"Angular is not an option, Ember is not an option, Sorry, I want to build performant web apps"

recording #1: 1:11:00
"We are trying to do too much in the name of developer comfort"

webpack has a syntax to load js that is specific to a page and no where else

TODO read all of the redux docs

I missed his description of store... see #2 at 1:17:00+

connect wraps your component and implements shouldComponentUpdate and calls your "select" methods to determine if rendering is necessary.

js dependency visualization
https://kenneth.io/blog/2013/04/01/visualize-your-javaScript-dependencies-with-dependo/

show selectively pulling-in polyfills. see root.js and helpers/polifills.js
then show safari vs chrome, fetch and promise are large polyfills so use this functionality instead of just letting babbel add it for everyone.

they really need to be logged out of github also, but that's a big oauth question that doesn't have one good answer.


to deploy
register app with github
... see readme
see github-secret-keeper
it has a deploy to heroku button.
add your secret to secret keeper instance
    client id is keyname (left side), secret is value (right side) within heroku

for surge, create 200.html file. so that /auth/callback goes somewhere and doesn't 404
